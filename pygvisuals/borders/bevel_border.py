        Initialisation of a BevelBorder.

        Args:
            width: The width of the border.
                This can either be an integer for the width of both the left and right side
                or a tuple for each side specifically (left, right).
            height: The height of the border.
                This can either be an integer for the height of both the top and bottom side
                or a tuple for each side specifically (top, bottom).
            upper: A color-like object that can be interpreted as a color by pygame (such as a tuple with RGB values).
                This will be used as the color for the upper side of the border.
            lower: A color-like object that can be interpreted as a color by pygame (such as a tuple with RGB values).
                This will be used as the color for the lower side of the border.
            lower_has_left_side: A boolean indicating whether the left side
                will be filled in with the same color as the lower/bottom side.
                The default is False, which means that the left side will have the same color as the top side.
