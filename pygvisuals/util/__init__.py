    """
    Add docstrings for methods of the class from its superclasses and return it.

    Every function from the given class without a __doc__-attribute or with
    a __doc__-attribute containing the given specifier will get a copy of
    a __doc__-attribute from a function with the same name from one of its superclasses.

    This can be used as a decorator.

    This function was taken and modified from the 'Stack Overflow' network.

    Args:
        cls: A class to modify.
        doc_inheritance_specifier: A string to search for in the __doc__-attributes of functions.
            If this string is found, it will be replaced with the found __doc__ from a superclass;
            the rest of the __doc__ attribute remains as before.
            If this is a falsy value (e.g. None), no such specifier will be searched for;
            instead only functions without a __doc__ attribute will inherit docstrings from superclasses.

    Returns:
        The class supplied (with the modifications made).
